This repository is meant to do two things:

1. Store results as I recreate artifacts while following Christopher Samiullah's FastAPI Ultimate Tutorial:

    * Tutorials: [https://christophergs.com/python/2021/12/04/fastapi-ultimate-tutorial/](https://christophergs.com/python/2021/12/04/fastapi-ultimate-tutorial/)
    * Source code: [https://github.com/ChristopherGS/ultimate-fastapi-tutorial](https://github.com/ChristopherGS/ultimate-fastapi-tutorial)

2. Extend the tutorial material to include OIDC authentication and (hopefully) SSO.

See [NOTES](./NOTES.md) for comments, issues, and problem-solving that needed to occur while following.
